# Day 56: June 24, 2018

Today's Progress: 
- Didn't code much today because I talked to my friends and my mom. Family comes first

- June 23: Didn't code today either because I went to san francisco with my college professor who is visiting.

- June 24: Counting this day as day 56.
- Was able to code up the hero section of the project I've been working on.
