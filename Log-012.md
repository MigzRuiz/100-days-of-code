# Day 12: May 5, 2018

Today's Progress: 
- Finished the design aesthetic of my budget app.
- Was able to learn and practice JS architecture and what it really means to built modularized code.

Thoughts: 
Today was a productive day for me, spent 5 hours on this project. Learned so much about working with JS modules
