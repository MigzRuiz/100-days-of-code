# Day 7: April 30, 2018

Today's Progress: 
- Completed 3 chapters of the JS Course, almost done with the pig game

Thoughts: 
Felt good today because I solved all the things that are needed even before completing the videos for the course. Also, today marks the first week of my 100 days of code challenge.
