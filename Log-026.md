# Day 26: May 23, 2018

Today's Progress: 
- Finished Section 1 of the Modern React with Redux course.
- Spent my lunch break some webflow videos.

Thoughts:
- There are a lot of big technical concepts to grasp in learning React. I think I'm getting most of it but I strongly feel I need more practice and to do some of the thinking by myself.
