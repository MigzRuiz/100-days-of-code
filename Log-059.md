# Day 59: June 27, 2018

Today's Progress: 
- Coded some more features for the personal project
- Listened to a lot of design podcast today
- Did 2 javascript exercises in freecodecamp

Thoughts: today was great, learned a lot from listening to the futur podcast. I was amazed by the single line code that solved the javascript project. I read .find method
