# Day 27: May 24, 2018

Today's Progress: 
- Troubleshoot my react project
- Refreshed my memory on ES6 topics: rest and default parameters
- Tried out WebFlow today as well

Thoughts:
- I ran into some issues with opening my react project earlier, getting errors such as no style.css can be found or bundle.js can't be found.
- Figured out the issue that I wasn't using localhost:8080
- Roll back to previous commits.
