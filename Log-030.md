# Day 30: May 27, 2018

Today's Progress: 
- Learned how to use Adobe XD for Wireframing and Designing webpages.
- Was able to finish the Youtube Clone React project.

Thoughts: Today was an awesome day, I got to learn a much more smoother way of designing my webpages/web apps with Adobe XD. I was able to finish my Reach Project today as well because I made a conscious choice on giving myself a deadline to complete something.
